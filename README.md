Information on more than 180,000 Terrorist Attacks

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

Publications
The GTD has been leveraged extensively in scholarly publications, reports, and media articles. Putting Terrorism in Context: Lessons from the Global Terrorism Database, by GTD principal investigators LaFree, Dugan, and Miller investigates patterns of terrorism and provides perspective on the challenges of data collection and analysis. The GTD's data collection manager, Michael Jensen, discusses important Benefits and Drawbacks of Methodological Advancements in Data Collection and Coding.
